    <p>You can measure the value of money by how much it will buy in foreign currencies, the demand for Treasury notes, and how much is held in foreign exchange reserves.
        When the value of money declines over time and the prices of goods increase, it is called inflation.
        When prices fall steadily over time and the value of money increases, it is called deflation, and it can have a harrowing effect on the economy.
        It is more valuable to have money today than to have money in the future because of the money's earnings potential; this is the time value of money.

    <p>Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) can be defined as organisms (i.e. plants, animals or microorganisms) in which the genetic material (DNA) has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally by mating and/or natural recombination. The technology is often called “modern biotechnology” or “gene technology”, sometimes also “recombinant DNA technology” or “genetic engineering”. It allows selected individual genes to be transferred from one organism into another, also between nonrelated species. Foods produced from or using GM organisms are often referred to as GM foods.

    <p>In the year 2100, the world is expected to undergo dramatic transformations driven by advanced technologies. Virtual realities may become hyper-personalized, allowing people to live in fantastical worlds tailored to their dreams, though they could also pose risks if used for punishment. Cities are anticipated to evolve into massive arcologies, enormous structures that integrate all aspects of daily life and are resilient to natural disasters. Force fields could become a reality, offering advanced protection through multi-layered shields against various threats. Knowledge and skills might be directly downloaded into our brains, vastly improving learning and intelligence but potentially creating disparities between altered and non-altered individuals. Additionally, a global network could enable a hive mind or telepathic communication, allowing people to share thoughts, emotions, and memories instantaneously. These changes will reshape human life, presenting both exciting possibilities and challenges as society adapts.
